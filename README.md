# Timebloks

This project has been made in orther to increase my productivity when working organizing my work time in blocks.

## Instalation

In orther to make it easyer to execute the program i use a permanent alias. To make this you can:

Write into the comand line:
```bash
vim ~/.bash_aliases
```
Append to the file:
```bash
alias work='python3 /path/to/your/containing/dir/timeblocks/work.sh'
```
Save and close the file and activate your alias typing:
```bash
source ~/.bash_aliases
```
## Usage

If you have done the alias type work in your comand line and automatically a window will open. Else, go to the directory and execute the work.sh script.
